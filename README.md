# RunUO_v1.x
An Ultima Onlineâ„¢ Server Emulator: Last Official Release 

## Project Background
> The restructuring of both the code and the directories within this project will make this emulator fork seem like it has been modified from the original source; I can assure you that *all of the code contained herein has been left unmodified*. The changes which have been made to this repository aim to add uniformity between all major version releases of RunUO. My end-goal for all of this is to be able to cross-reference the evolution of code changes between the different versions of RunUO. This will ultimately make converting source code and third-party scripts from one emulation server version to another a lot less tedious of a job.

## Why No Microsoft Visual Studio Solution and Project Files?
> I have refrained from adding the entire Microsoft Visual Studio source to the repositories because I didn't want to confuse people with the way they are set up. If you would like the Microsoft Visual Studio source that corresponds to this repository, then you can email me and request it: aasr-cdev@protonmail.com

# RunUO_v1.x
An Ultima Online™ Server Emulator: Last Official Release 

## Project Background
> The restructuring of both the code and the directories within this project will make this emulator fork seem like it has been modified from the original source; I can assure you that *all of the code contained herein has been left unmodified*. The changes which have been made to this repository aim to add uniformity between all major version releases of RunUO.

> My end-goal for all of this is to be able to cross-reference the evolution of code changes between the different versions of RunUO. The reason this is important is so that server owners can utilize older versions of the RunUO Ultima Online™ Server Emulator with confidence knowing that if they need to add an update from a newer version, they can without an issue.

## Why No Visual Studio Source?
> I have refrained from adding the entire Visual Studio source to the repositories because I didn't want to confuse people with the way they are set up. If you would like the Visual Studio source then you can email me and request it: aasr-cdev@protonmail.com
